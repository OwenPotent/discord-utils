# Utilia
 An NPM package for you to use on your Discord Bot or JavaScript projects! This is still however in development and countless of errors have been encountered, if you wish to help me add features, make a pull request at the github page!

## What's New?

### Added
- LoggerClass | A more advanced but configurable logger that console logs useful information given. To use this refer to the example below:

```js
const { Logger } = require("utilia")

const logger = new Logger()

logger.success("Hello world")
```

## TODO

With NPM:
